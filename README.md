Collabrative white board
==========

This is an android app that allows users to draw collabratively in real time. 
The app connects to a server running on the google app engine, to receive paint strokes from other applications currently connected to the same drawing.

Currenlty, single drawing is supported. i.e all apps connected draw on the same drawing, send and receive paints strokes from all other apps.
